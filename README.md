This project implements a machine learning-based system for automatic detection and classification of skin diseases from dermoscopic images using advanced image processing and segmentation techniques.

**Key Features**

**Comprehensive Preprocessing Pipeline:**

Digital hair removal using morphological Black-Hat transformation and inpainting

Noise reduction with Gaussian filtering

Image standardization (resizing to 512Ã—512 pixels)

**Advanced Segmentation:**

Automatic GrabCut algorithm for precise lesion isolation

k-means clustering for improved segmentation

**Feature Extraction:**

Texture analysis using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)

Statistical features (mean, variance, standard deviation, RMS)

Color space transformations (RGB, HSV, LAB)

**Machine Learning Classification:**

Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree classifiers

Multiclass handling for 8 skin disease types

Random oversampling to address class imbalance

**Performance:**

Achieves up to 97% accuracy on benchmark datasets (ISIC 2019 and HAM10000)

Comprehensive evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

**Technical Specifications**
